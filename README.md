## Overview
**Daily Tasks** is a Kanban board interface designed to help you create, control, and visualize your tasks efficiently. This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing key functionalities and a clean, user-friendly interface for task management.

## üöÄ Features
- **üîê User Authentication**: Create your own user account to segregate tasks. Since this is a portfolio project, email validation is not required; user accounts are for identification purposes only.
- **üìã Kanban Board**: 
  - Create and describe tasks.
  - Add one or more tags for easy identification of task subjects.
  - Use drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between columns (To-Do, In Progress, Done).
- **üè∑Ô∏è Tags**:
  - Create as many tags as needed to organize your tasks.
  - Filter tasks by tag directly on the Kanban board.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
The project contains separate installation guides for the frontend and backend components. Detailed instructions will be provided in their respective folders:
- [Frontend Installation Guide](./frontend/README.md)
- [Backend Installation Guide](./backend/README.md)
